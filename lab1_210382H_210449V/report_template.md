# CS4532 – Take Home Lab 1 (Template)

**Group:** `<Index1>, <Index2>`  
**Machine:** *(Fill: CPU model, cores/threads, RAM, OS, governor/turbo)*

## Step 2 – Implementations
- Serial baseline (sorted singly linked list).
- Pthreads with one global mutex.
- Pthreads with one global read–write lock.
*(Briefly describe design choices, invariants, and how timing excludes init.)*

## Step 3 – Results (±5% @ 95% CI)

### Case 1: n=1000, m=10000, mMember=0.99, mInsert=0.005, mDelete=0.005
| Impl | Threads | Average (ms) | Std (ms) |
|------|---------|--------------|----------|
| Serial | 1 |  |  |
| Mutex | 1 |  |  |
| Mutex | 2 |  |  |
| Mutex | 4 |  |  |
| Mutex | 8 |  |  |
| RW-Lock | 1 |  |  |
| RW-Lock | 2 |  |  |
| RW-Lock | 4 |  |  |
| RW-Lock | 8 |  |  |

*(Repeat the table format for Case 2 and Case 3.)*

## Step 4 – Plots
- Include three figures (one per case) generated by `tools/plot.py`.

## Step 5 – Discussion
- Read-heavy vs write-heavy behavior.
- Amdahl’s law implications and scaling limits.
- Sources of variance; verification that only **m-ops** were timed.
